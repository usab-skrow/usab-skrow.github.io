Nice, so you have been shortlisted for the interview. Now to do well in them you need good preparation. 

## Objectives of interviews.

There are primarily 2 broader areas that checked.
1. Technical Aptitude
2. Interpersonal

### Technical Aptitude

#### Study Areas
1. The Essentials
    1. Computer Science 
        1. Data Structure & Algorithm
        2. Software Design Patterns
    2. Primary programming language (the application logic on server side): Java, Scala, Ruby, Python, GoLang, C++ etc
    3. Database (the place to store suff): RDBMS - MySQL, PostgreSQL.. NoSQL - MongoDb, Cassandra, Couchbase, Neo4j 
    4. Secondary scripting language (to automate lot of repetitive work) - Bash, Powershell
    5. UI Scripts (the application logic on user side): Javascript, Typescript
    6. Testing (unit & integration): junit, spock, pytest..
    7. Source Control (manage your code): git
2. The Good to Have (which has become essential in top tech especially for senior engineers, its good to know a few of the below)
    1. System communication (for communication between separate systems): REST API, gRPC
    2. Caches (make things faster): Redis, Memcached
    3. Message Queues (make things asynchronous): Kafka, RabbitMQ
    4. Data storage optimisation (remove database performance bottlenecks): Sharding, Partitioning
    5. Load Balancing (handle and direct user traffic to servers): Nginx, F5 
    6. Data management (to make sure product can scale): Replication, Archival
    7. Logging (essential for troubleshooting): Log4j..
    8. CICD (build & deploy): Github, Gitlab, Jenkins..
    9. Cloud Stack (run in cloud production): Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana..
    10. Big Data Stack (process large unstructured data): Apache Hadoop, Spark, MapReduce
    11. Multithreaded applications (making sure to use all the cores in the CPU asynchronously): best practices, race conditions, common issues
    12. IAM (identity and access management): Single Sign On, Oauth2.0, Token 
3. Amazing if you know them.
    1. Distributed Systems design patterns & fallacies
    2. ACID principles
    3. SOLID principles
    4. Configuration vs Customization
    5. CAP Theorem
    6. Architecture best practices
    7. Networking best practices
    8. Service Oriented Architecture
    9. API design best practices

#### Interview Types
1. Initial Screening : Mostly covers **DSA**, OOP design, SQL, Design Patterns
    1. Online Coding Test: You code in an online editor within a limited time to solve 1 or more problems. There are background tests that your code need to clear. Focus on optimal implementation. Do NOT expect linting, auto complete or syntax highlight.
    2. Phone Screening: Similar to the above, you are on a call with an engineer from the company with a shared code editor/doc in front. Interviewer will ask questions on your coding decisions & possibly follow up on your solution. You speak to the interviewer while you code. It focusses on your communication skills, ingenuity and clarity of thought. It is also designed to prevent fraud.
2. Main Rounds (2--5 rounds, might be done all on the same day): All of them are with another engineer from the company
    1. DSA round (possibly more than 1): Checks if you code keeping time and space complexity in mind.
    2. OOP round: Checks if your code is modular, readable and is easily extensible.
    3. Work Sample Simulation: Checks how you approach a real world project. Covers design, coding, testing & documentation.
    4. Fix the Bug: Checks how you debug a problem.
    5. System Design Round: Checks if you can visualize the larger picture and design a distributed system keeping future changes in mind. 

### Interpersonal

#### Interview Types
1. Meet the Team: This round is basically for the team members to meet the potential new member and provide feedback to the Hiring Manager if they would like to have you on their team. Bonding is essential for the team's success. Think of it as a "vibe check".
2. Hiring Manager: This round is basically for the manager to evaluate you as a reportee. To see if you will bond well in the team's culture, vision and social aspects. Your ambitions , short & long term plans and your expectations from the company and team are also discussed. It is important to note that depending on the manager and the company, they might look for "culture add" vs "culture fit". Also discussion around team leadership roles if applicable.
3. Leadership: This round is mostly a meet and greet with a VP or Senior Director under whose org you will join. Its informal and open ended.
4. Program/Product Manager: This round is a meeting with the program/product manager of the project on which you will work on. Its also informal and revolves around project vision, roadmap and your past experiences. 


Note: You may encounter only 1 or multiple rounds as listed here. This document captures most common variations of interviews.
